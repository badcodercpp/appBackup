PM’s Special Address to the Nation
20 Oct, 2020      

PM appeals to citizens to not let their guard down in the country’s fight against Corona

Says the lockdown might have gone but the virus has not

Cautions this is not the time for callousness and complacency

Lauds the efforts of the doctors, nurses and other Corona Warriors for their selfless service to the nation

Work on vaccine is in progress and Govt is readying a strategy to deliver the vaccine to every single citizen

Recovery rate in the country has improved and the fatality rate is low : PM

In a televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi made a fervent appeal to all the citizens to not let their guard down and become complacent, in the country’s ongoing fight against the Covid Pandemic.

Shri Narendra Modi said despite the lockdown having been lifted it does not mean that the Corona Virus is wiped out.

He appreciated the improvement in the situation all over the country and that economic activity is returning to normal and that people started moving out of their houses to fulfill the responsibilities.

Shri Modi observed that markets have also started returning to normalcy with the advent of the festivities.

He said India is in a better situation due to the efforts of every Indian in the last 7-8 months and one should not let it deteriorate.

The Prime Minister noted that the recovery rate in the country has improved and the fatality rate is low. Shri Modi stated that for every 10 Lakh Citizens about 5500 were infected with corona, while in countries like the US and Brazil the figure is nearly 25000.

He said that the death rate in India is 83 for every 10 Lakh Citizens , whereas in developed countries like the US, Brazil, Spain, Britain and many other countries it is about 600.

The Prime Minister appreciated that in comparison to many developed nations, India is getting successful in protecting many lives of its citizens in the country.

The Prime Minister mentioned the improvement of the Covid Infrastructure in the country. He said more than 90 Lakh beds are available for corona patients along with 12000 Quarantine centres across the country.

He said over 2000 Corona Testing 2000 labs are functional all over the country, while the number of tests will soon cross 10 Crore.

He said India is succeeding in saving the lives of more and more of its citizens in comparison to the resource-rich countries and that the increasing number of tests has been a great strength in the country’s fight against the Covid pandemic.

The Prime Minister lauded the efforts of the doctors, nurses and health workers who are selflessly serving such a large population, following the mantra of “Seva Parmo Dharma.”

He warned people not to be callous, amidst all these efforts and not to assume that the corona virus is gone, or that there is no danger from the corona now.

Cautioning the people who have stopped taking precautions of late, he said “If you are negligent and going out without a mask, you are exposing yourself, your family, your children, the elderly to the same amount of risk.”

The Prime Minister referred to the ongoing situation in the US and Europe where the number of cases of Corona initially decreased but then suddenly started increasing.

He urged the people not to be negligent until a vaccine against the pandemic is found and let the fight against the Covid-19 weaken.

The Prime Minister said efforts are on a war footing to save humanity and many countries including the country's scientists are working on the production of a vaccine.

He said the work is going on various vaccines against corona and that some of these are in an advanced stage.

The Prime Minister said the Government is also preparing a detailed road map to reach the vaccine to every single citizen as soon as it is readily available.

He again urged the people to not lax until the vaccine is done.

The Prime Minister said we are going through a difficult time and a little carelessness can lead to a great crisis and tarnish our happiness.

He urged citizens to be vigilant while fulfilling their responsibilities.

He appealed to the citizens to maintain the 6 feet distance (Do Gaj ki Doori), to wash their hands with soap periodically and to wear face masks.

Our country has kept the mortality rates low.

Medical infrastructure has been ramped up, testing capacity has been significantly scaled up.

These are positive signs.

PM’s address to the nation
20 Oct, 2020      

My dear countrymen!

Namaskar!

We, all the Indians have come a long way in the fight against Corona, since the Janata curfew till today. With time, the economic activities also seem to have picked up gradually. Most of us are stepping out of our homes every day to discharge our responsibilities and to give momentum to life again. In this festive season, the hustle and bustle of the markets is gradually returning. But we must not forget that even though the lockdown has been lifted, the virus is still present. We must not allow the stable situation that India has been able to achieve in the last 7-8 months with the effort of every Indian to deteriorate. We have to improve further.

Today the recovery rate in the country has improved a lot and the fatality rate is low. In India, about 5500 people per 10 lakh population have contracted coronavirus, while in countries like America and Brazil, this figure is close to 25,000. In India, the death rate is 83 per 10 lakh people, while in many countries like America, Brazil, Spain and Britain, this figure is more than 600. India is succeeding in saving the lives of more and more of its citizens compared to the resource-rich countries of the world. Today, more than 90 lakh beds are available for Corona patients in our country. There are 12,000 Quarantine Centres. There are around 2000 labs for corona testing. The number of Tests conducted in the country will soon cross the 10 crore mark. The increasing number of tests has been a major strength in our fight against the Covid pandemic.

Our doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, security personnel and other people are serving such a large population selflessly following the mantra of 'Seva Parmo Dharma'. Amidst all these efforts, this is not the time to be careless. This is not the time to assume that the corona is not there anymore, or that there is no danger from the corona now. In recent times, we have all seen various pictures and videos in which it is clear that many people have now stopped taking precautions, or have become too careless. This is not good at all. If you are careless and are walking out without a mask, then you are putting yourself, your family, your children, and the elderly in a lot of trouble. Keep in mind, be it America or the countries in Europe, Corona cases were declining in these countries, but suddenly the cases are increasing again, that too alarmingly.

Friends,

Sant Kabirdas Ji has said- पकी खेती देखिके, गरब किया किसान। अजहूं झोला बहुत है, घर आवै तब जान। That means, often we become extremely confident that the work is done just by looking at the ripe crop. But till the harvest comes home, the work should not be considered accomplished. This is what Kabirdas has said. That is, do not be negligent until success is attained.

Friends,

Until the vaccine against this virus is available, we must not let our fight with Corona weaken even for once. After several years we are seeing that the work is being done all over the world on a war footing to save humanity. Many countries are working towards it. Scientists of our country are also working hard for vaccine. Work is underway on several corona vaccines currently in India. Some of these are at advanced stages. The situation seems to be reassuring.

Friends,

The government is also preparing to look for ways to deliver the vaccine to every Indian as soon as possible whenever the vaccine against Corona arrives. And the work on ensuring delivery of the vaccine to every citizen is being done at a fast pace.

Friends,

Ramcharitmanas has a lot to teach. But at the same time there are various types of warnings. For example, a very crucial thing has been mentioned in Ramcharitmanas.रिपु रुज पावक पाप, प्रभु अहि गनिअ न छोट करि। That is, fire, enemy and sin; i.e., mistakes and diseases should never be considered small. Until these are fully treated or dealt with, these should not be taken lightly. So remember, there should not be any laxity unless there is a medicine. The time of festivals is a time for joy in our lives.

We are passing through a difficult time; a little carelessness can hinder our progress and spoil our happiness. Undertaking the responsibilities of life and being vigilant should go hand in hand; only then will there be happiness in life. Be mindful of social distancing or do gaz doori, frequent washing of hands with soap and wearing a mask. And it is my humble request to all of you; I want to see you safe; I want to see your family happy. May these festivals create an atmosphere of increased enthusiasm and zeal in your lives and that is why I am repeatedly urging every citizen.

Today I also want to request my media friends and those who are active on social media that the more public awareness campaigns you create to follow these rules the greater service you all will be doing to the country. You must support us and support the crores of people of the country.

My dear countrymen,

Stay healthy, move ahead at a fast pace and we all together should take the country forward. With these best wishes, I once again greet all the countrymen on the occasion of all the festivals including Navratri, Dussehra, Eid, Deepawali, Chhath Puja and Gurunanak Jayanti.

Thank you!

 India’s fight against COVID-19 has been a spirited one.

Our country has kept the mortality rates low.

Medical infrastructure has been ramped up, testing capacity has been significantly scaled up.

These are positive signs.

PM delivers keynote address at Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020
The future will be shaped by societies that invest in science and innovation : PM

India is already working on putting a well-established Vaccine delivery system in place to ensure immunisation of our citizens : PM

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi delivered the keynote address at Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said the future will be shaped by societies that invest in science and innovation. He said the benefits of science and innovation can be reaped at the right time by investing in it well in advance, instead of having a short sighted approach. He said the journey to these innovations must be shaped by collaboration and public participation. He added science will never prosper in silos and the Grand Challenges Programme has understood this ethos well. He commended the scale of this programme wherein several nations were engaged globally and addressed diverse issues such as Antimicrobial Resistance, Maternal and Child Health, Agriculture, Nutrition, WaSH - (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), and many others.

The Prime Minister said the global pandemic has made us realise the importance of teamwork. He said the diseases do not have geographic boundaries and do not discriminate on the grounds of faith, race, gender or colour. He added these diseases also include several communicable and non-communicable diseases that are impacting people. He said a strong & vibrant scientific community and good scientific institutions in India have been India’s greatest assets, especially during the last few months, while fighting COVID-19. He added they have achieved wonders from containment to capacity building.

The Prime Minister said COVID-19 death rate in India is very low in spite of the large population due to the people powered and people driven approach. He added today, there is a decline in the number of cases per day, decline in the growth rate of cases and has one of the highest recovery rates of 88 percent. He said this happened because India: was one of the first countries to adopt a flexible lockdown, was one of the first to encourage the usage of masks, actively began to work on effective contact-tracing and was one of the earliest to deploy the rapid antigen tests.

The Prime Minister remarked India is now at the forefront of vaccine development for COVID. He announced more than 30 indigenous vaccines are being developed in our country and three of them are in an advanced stage. He said India is already working on putting a well-established Vaccine delivery system in place and this digitised network along with digital health ID will be used to ensure immunisation of our citizens. He pointed that India is known for its proven capacity to produce quality medicines and vaccines at low cost. More than 60 percent of the Vaccines for Global Immunisation are being manufactured in India. He said with India’s experience and research talent, India will be at the centre of global healthcare efforts and desires to help other nations enhance their capacities in these sectors.

The Prime Minister listed many interventions made in the last 6 years like better sanitation, improved cleanliness, more toilet coverage which has contributed to a better healthcare system. He said this has helped the women, poor & under-privileged and led to a reduction in diseases. He further listed the efforts of the Government in ensuring disease reduction and bringing better healthcare to the villages like providing piped drinking water to every household, setting up medical colleges in rural areas and running the world’s largest health insurance scheme.

The Prime Minister urged to keep using the collaborative spirit for individual empowerment and collective well-being. He wished for fruitful and productive deliberations and hoped to see many exciting and encouraging new solutions coming out from this Grand Challenges platform.

PM&#8217;s keynote address at Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020
Namaste!

Melinda and Bill Gates, Union Minister in my Cabinet, Dr Harsh Vardhan, Delegates from across the world, Scientists, Innovators, Researchers, Students, Friends, I am happy to be with all of you, for this sixteenth Grand Challenges Annual Meeting.

This meeting was to be held physically in India. But, in changed circumstances it is being held virtually. Such is the power of technology that a global pandemic did not keep us apart. This programme has continued as per schedule. This shows the commitment of the grand challenges community. It shows a commitment to adapt and innovate.

Friends,

The future will be shaped by societies that invest in science and innovation. But, this cannot be done in a short-sighted manner. One has to invest in science and innovation well in advance. That is when we can reap  benefits at the right time. Similarly, the journey to these innovations must be shaped by collaboration and public participation. Science will never prosper in silos. The Grand Challenges Programme has understood this ethos well. The scale of this programme is commendable .

In 15 years, you have engaged with several nations globally. The nature of issues addressed is diverse. You have combined bright global talent to address problems such as: Antimicrobial Resistance, Maternal  and Child Health, Agriculture, Nutrition, WaSH - water, sanitation and hygiene. And many others are welcome initiatives.

Friends,

It has taken a global pandemic to make us realise yet again the importance of teamwork. Afterall, diseases do not have geographic boundaries. Diseases do not discriminate on the grounds of faith, race, gender or colour. And, by diseases  I am not only talking about the current pandemic situation. There are several communicable and non-communicable diseases that are impacting people, specially, bright youngsters.

Friends,

In India, we have a strong and vibrant scientific community. We also have very good scientific institutions. They have been India’s greatest assets, specially during the last several months, while fighting COVID-19. From containment to capacity building, they have achieved wonders.

Friends,

India’s size, scale and diversity has always made the global community curious. Our nation is almost four times the size of the USA's population. Many of our states are as populated as European nations. Yet, thanks to a people powered and people driven approach, India kept its COVID-19 death rate very low. Today, we are seeing a decline in the number of cases per day and the growth rate of cases. India has one of the highest recovery rates of 88 percent. This happened because: India was one of the first countries to adopt a flexible lockdown when the total cases were just a few hundred. India was one of the first to encourage the usage of masks. India actively began to work on effective contact-tracing.  India was one of the earliest to deploy the rapid antigen tests. India has also innovated CRISPR gene editing technology.

Friends,

India is now at the forefront of vaccine development for COVID. More than 30 indigenous vaccines are being developed in our country, Three of them are in an advanced stage. We are not stopping here. India is already working on putting a well-established Vaccine delivery system in place. This digitised network along with digital health ID will be used to ensure immunisation of our citizens.

Friends,

Beyond Covid too, India is known for its proven capacity to produce quality medicines and vaccines at low cost. More than 60 percent of the Vaccines for Global Immunisation are being manufactured in India. We included Indigenous Rotavirus Vaccine in our Indradhanush Immunisation  programme. This is a successful example of a strong partnership/ for long lasting results. The Gates Foundation has also been a part of this particular effort. With India’s experience and research talent, we will be at the centre of global healthcare efforts. We want to help other nations enhance their capacities in these sectors.

Friends,

In the last 6 years we have made many interventions which are contributing to a better healthcare system. Take a subject such as sanitation. Improved cleanliness. More toilet coverage. Who does this help the most?  It helps the poor and under-privileged. It leads to a reduction in diseases. It also helps women the most.

Friends,

Now, we are ensuring that each household gets piped drinking water. This will further ensure disease reduction. We are setting up more medical colleges, especially in rural areas. This ensures more opportunities for the youth. It brings better healthcare to our villages. We are running the world’s largest health insurance scheme and ensuring access to everyone.

Friends,

May we keep using our collaborative spirit for individual empowerment and collective well-being. The Gates Foundation, and several other organisations are doing wonderful work. I wish you all fruitful and productive deliberations over the next 3 days. I hope to see many exciting and encouraging new solutions coming out from this Grand Challenges platform. May these efforts further a human centric approach to development. May they also give our youth the opportunities to be thought leaders for a brighter future. Once again, I thank the organisers for inviting me.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

PM addresses the Centenary Convocation of the University of Mysore
19 Oct, 2020      

PM addresses the Centenary Convocation of the University of Mysore
Infrastructure creation and Structural Reforms were given special focus in the Education Sector Reforms : PM

National Education Policy would give new direction and new strength to the Education Sector Reforms : PM

At all levels of education in the country, the Gross Enrolment ratio of girls is more than boys: PM

Skilling, Reskilling and Upskilling is the biggest need of the hour : PM

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Centenary Convocation 2020 of the University of Mysore today through video conference.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said the University of Mysore is the center of the great education system of ancient India, the aspirations and capabilities of future India and has realized the vision of "Rajarshi" Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and M. Visvesvaraya Ji.

He referred to stalwarts like Bharat Ratna Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji who taught at the University.

Prime Minister exhorted the students to use their knowledge obtained through education at various stages of their real life. He termed real life as a great university which teaches various ways for applicability of knowledge.

The Prime Minister quoted the words of the great kannada writer and thinker Goruru Ramaswamy Iyengar Ji that “education throws light at difficult times in life”.

He said continuous efforts are being made so that India’s Education system caters to the needs of the 21st century where in Infrastructure creation and Structural Reforms were given special focus. He said to make India a Global Hub for Higher Education and to make our youth competitive, efforts were made Qualitatively as well as Quantitatively.

The Prime Minister said even after so many years of independence, in 2014 there were only 16 IITs in the country. In the last 6 years, on average, a new IIT has been opened every year. One of them is also at Dharwad, Karnataka. He added as of 2014 there were only 9 IIITs, 13 IIMs and 7 AIIMSs in the country. Whereas in the subsequent 5 years, 16 IIITs, 7 IIMs and 8 AIIMSs were either established or in the process of being created.

The Prime Minister said efforts in higher education over the last 5 - 6 years are not limited to only opening new institutions but work has also been done on governance reforms in these institutions to ensure gender equality and social inclusiveness. More autonomy is being given to such institutions as well so that they can take decisions according to their needs.

He said the first IIM Act gave more rights to IIMs across the country. The National Medical Commission has been created to bring more transparency in medical education. Two new laws are also being enacted for bringing in reforms in Homeopathy and other Indian medical practices.

The Prime Minister expressed happiness thatnat all levels of education in the country, the Gross Enrolment ratio of girls is more than boys.

The Prime Minister said the new National Education Policy would give new impetus by bringing about fundamental changes in the entire education sector.

He said the focus of the National Education Policy is multidimensional to make our youth competitive through a flexible and adaptable education system. He said Skilling, Reskilling and Upskilling is the greatest need of the hour.

Being one of the best education institutes in the country, the Prime Minister urged the University of Mysore to innovate according to the new emerging situation. He urged the institute to focus on Incubation Centers, Technology Development Centers, 'Industry-academia linkage' and 'Inter- disciplinary research '. He requested the University to promote research on Local Culture, Local Art and other social issues along with related global and contemporary issues. He urged the students to try to achieve excellence on the basis of their individual strengths.
